Additions in the project:
- I have finished the second tutorial:

--> hearts come out feeding sheep.

--> There is a score of fed sheep and sheep that have fallen.

--> There is a title menu with the star button to start, quit to close the game. 
    and if you click on the machine on the side you can select the color to play.


- I have added more:

--> two types of extra sheep:
	- Golden sheep, it's faster than the normal sheep, it gives 5 points and if it falls it doesn't take life.
	- Black Sheep, it is slower than the normal sheep, but you have to feed it 2 times 
	  and if it falls it counts as 2 normal sheep.
